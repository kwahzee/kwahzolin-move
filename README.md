    osc2 clocks the register on every positive zero crossing.
    osc1's sign becomes the new bit.
    the accumulated register value spills back as voltage.
    this is a rungler. rob hordijk's circuit.
```

2 oscillators, triangle-shaped, circling each other. osc2 is the clock. every upswing pushes a new bit into the 8-bit shift register from osc1's sign. the register value feeds back into both oscillator frequencies and into the filter's cutoff.

**osc 1 frequency** — base pitch of the first triangle oscillator. the rungler and lfo can sweep it.

**osc 2 frequency** — clock rate of the kwahzolin. slow osc2 means the rungler evolves languidly. fast osc2 and everything seizes up.

**osc chaos** — how deep the rungler effects both oscillator frequencies.

**filter cutoff** — resting mouth of the state variable filter. the rungler and lfo drag it around.

**filter resonance** — filter self-feedback amount.

**filter chaos** — scales how far the rungler throws the cutoff on each clock tick.

**cross mod** — bidirectional FM between the two oscillators. each oscillator's frequency is offset by the other's triangle output. at low amounts: subtle detuning and beating. at high amounts: harsh inharmonic FM feedback that interacts with the rungler chaos.

**loop** — turing machine register control. at zero: random. at one: locked. in the middle: mutation.

## menu

jog wheel scrolls. jog click selects or toggles edit mode. back button returns to main menu.

### lfo

three lfos. each targets any of the 8 knob parameters at audio-rate resolution. shift + jog switches between lfo 1 / 2 / 3.

| property | range |
|----------|-------|
| shape    | triangle / sine / square / sawtooth / s&h / wander |
| rate     | 0.05 hz – 100 hz |
| amount   | 0.0 – 1.0 |
| target   | any of the 8 knobs |

### distortion

distortion applied after the filter. toggle on/off independently of type and amount.

| type       | character |
|------------|-----------|
| overdrive  | soft tanh saturation, warm and tube-like |
| distortion | hard knee clipping, more aggressive |
| fuzz       | asymmetric hard clip, even harmonics, octave character |

| property | range | notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| type     | overdrive / distortion / fuzz | |
| amount   | 0.0 – 1.0 | drive amount |
| mix      | 0.0 – 1.0 | wet/dry blend |
| on/off   | toggle | |

output level compensation is applied automatically per distortion type so activating distortion does not increase loudness.
